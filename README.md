> ## Exploratory Data Analysis of Aircraft Crashes and Fatalites 

* Objective: The objective of this project is to analyze historical aircraft crash data and derive meaningful insights related to crash statistics, crash reasons, and notable trends. The analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of aircraft crashes, including yearly crash counts, passenger statistics, survival rates, operator and aircraft involvement, crash reasons, and associated fatalities.

* Project Approach: 
    1. Data Loading: We will start by loading the aircraft crash dataset, ensuring that all relevant fields, such as crash year, passenger count, survival status, operator, aircraft type, and crash summary, are available for analysis.

    2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: We will perform necessary data cleaning tasks, handling missing values, and ensuring the dataset is in a suitable format for analysis.

    3. Crash Statistics: We will analyze the dataset to determine the yearly number of plane crashes, the number of people on board, the number of survivors, and the number of fatalities for each year. These statistics will provide an overview of the crash trends over time.

    4. Operator and Aircraft Analysis: We will identify the operator with the highest number of crashes and analyze the types of aircraft involved in the most crashes. These insights will shed light on the performance of specific operators and aircraft types.

    5. Crash Reason Clustering: By analyzing the crash summary field, we will categorize crash reasons into different clusters, such as fire, shot down, weather, or "UNKNOWN" for blank entries. This clustering will help identify the primary reasons behind aircraft crashes.

    6. Crash Statistics by Reason Category: We will calculate the number of crashed aircraft and the number of deaths for each reason category obtained from the previous step. This analysis will provide a detailed understanding of the most common reasons for crashes and their associated fatalities.

    7. Interesting Trend Analysis: Exploratory data analysis will be conducted to uncover any interesting trends or behaviors present in the dataset. We will visualize patterns,
